# Rate my professor rag model

This is a app that uses retrieval augmented generation, RAG, to help students find the best professors for the job. The front end uses NextJs, ReactJs, and Material UI, while the backend uses Pinecone to store vectors for the embedded data and OpenAI to generate responses for prompts.
